		  applications, with their emphasis on numerical methods and
		  more complicated side conditions than equations, have
		  demanded deeper understanding of the concept and how it
		  fits into a larger theoretical picture. A major line of
		  research has been the nonsmooth geometry of one-sided
		  tangent and normal vectors to the set of points satisfying
		  the given constraints. Another has been the game-theoretic
		  role of multiplier vectors as solutions to a dual problem.
		  Interpretations as generalized derivatives of the optimal
		  value with respect to problem parameters have also been
		  explored. Lagrange multipliers are now being seen as
		  arising from a general rule for the subdifferentiation of a
		  nonsmooth objective function which allows black-and-white
		  constraints to be replaced by penalty expressions. This
		  paper traces such themes in the current theory of Lagrange
		  multipliers, providing along the way a free-standing
		  exposition of basic nonsmooth analysis as motivated by and
		  applied to this subject.},

		  is the sum of a smooth function and an
		  {\$}{\$}{\backslash}ell {\_}1{\$}{\$} ℓ 1 regularization
		  term. This method, which is sometimes referred to in the
		  literature as a proximal Newton method, computes a step by
		  minimizing a piecewise quadratic model
		  {\$}{\$}q{\_}k{\$}{\$} q k of the objective function
		  {\$}{\$}{\backslash}phi {\$}{\$} ϕ . In order to make this
		  approach efficient in practice, it is imperative to perform
		  this inner minimization inexactly. In this paper, we give
		  inexactness conditions that guarantee global convergence
		  and that can be used to control the local rate of
		  convergence of the iteration. Our inexactness conditions
		  are based on a semi-smooth function that represents a
		  (continuous) measure of the optimality conditions of the
		  problem, and that embodies the soft-thresholding iteration.
		  We give careful consideration to the algorithm employed for
		  the inner minimization, and report numerical results on two
		  test sets originating in machine learning."

		  arbitrary and unknown vector of errors. Is it possible to
		  recover f exactly from the data y? We prove that under

  abstract	= {Suppose we are given a matrix that is formed by adding an
		  unknown sparse matrix to an unknown low-rank matrix. Our
		  goal is to decompose the given matrix into its sparse and
		  low-rank components. Such a problem arises in a number of
		  applications in model and system identification, and is
		  NP-hard in general. In this paper we consider a convex
		  optimization formulation to splitting the specified matrix
		  into its components, by minimizing a linear combination of
		  the $\ell_1$ norm and the nuclear norm of the components.
		  We develop a notion of rank-sparsity incoherence, expressed
		  as an uncertainty principle between the sparsity pattern of
		  a matrix and its row and column spaces, and use it to
		  characterize both fundamental identifiability as well as
		  (deterministic) sufficient conditions for exact recovery.
		  Our analysis is geometric in nature, with the tangent
		  spaces to the algebraic varieties of sparse and low-rank
		  matrices playing a prominent role. When the sparse and
		  low-rank matrices are drawn from certain natural random
		  ensembles, we show that the sufficient conditions for exact
		  recovery are satisfied with high probability. We conclude
		  with simulation results on synthetic matrix decomposition
		  problems.}

  abstract	= {Suppose we are given a matrix that is formed by adding an
		  unknown sparse matrix to an unknown low-rank matrix. Our
		  goal is to decompose the given matrix into its sparse and
		  low-rank components. Such a problem arises in a number of
		  applications in model and system identification, and is
		  NP-hard in general. In this paper we consider a convex
		  optimization formulation to splitting the specified matrix
		  into its components, by minimizing a linear combination of
		  the $\ell_1$ norm and the nuclear norm of the components.
		  We develop a notion of rank-sparsity incoherence, expressed
		  as an uncertainty principle between the sparsity pattern of
		  a matrix and its row and column spaces, and use it to
		  characterize both fundamental identifiability as well as
		  (deterministic) sufficient conditions for exact recovery.
		  Our analysis is geometric in nature, with the tangent
		  spaces to the algebraic varieties of sparse and low-rank
		  matrices playing a prominent role. When the sparse and
		  low-rank matrices are drawn from certain natural random
		  ensembles, we show that the sufficient conditions for exact
		  recovery are satisfied with high probability. We conclude
		  with simulation results on synthetic matrix decomposition
		  problems.}

@Article{	  doh01,
  abstract	= {Suppose a discrete-time signal $S(t)$, $0 \leq t < N$, is
		  a superposition of atoms taken from a combined
		  time-frequency dictionary made of spike sequences
		  $1_{t=\tau}$ and sinusoids $\exp\{2\pi iw t/N\}/\sqrt{N}$.
		  Can one recover, from knowledge of $S$ alone, the precise
		  collection of atoms going to make up $S$? Because every
		  discrete-time signal can be represented as a superposition
		  of spikes alone, or as a superposition of sinusoids alone,
		  there is no unique way of writing S as a sum of spikes and
		  sinusoids in general. We prove that if $S$ is representable
		  as a highly sparse superposition of atoms from this
		  time-frequency dictionary, then there is only one such
		  highly sparse representation of $S$, and it can be obtained
		  by solving the convex optimization problem of minimizing
		  the $\ell^1$ norm of the coefficients among all
		  decompositions. Here ``highly sparse'' means that $N_t+N_w
		  < \sqrt{N}/2$ where $N_t$ is the number of time atoms,
		  $N_w$ is the number of frequency atoms, and $N$ is the
		  length of the discrete-time signal. Underlying this result
		  is a general $\ell^1$ uncertainty principle which says that
		  if two bases are mutually incoherent, no nonzero signal can
		  have a sparse representation in both bases simultaneously.
		  For the above setting, the bases are sinusoids and spikes,
		  and mutual incoherence is measured in terms of the largest
		  inner product between different basis elements. The
		  uncertainty principle holds for a variety of interesting
		  basis pairs, not just sinusoids and spikes. The results
		  have idealized applications to band-limited approximation
		  with gross errors, to error-correcting encryption, and to
		  separation of uncoordinated sources. Related phenomena hold
		  for functions of a real variable, with basis pairs such as
		  sinusoids and wavelets, and for functions of two variables,
		  with basis pairs such as wavelets and ridgelets. In these
		  settings, if a function f is representable by a
		  sufficiently sparse superposition of terms taken from both
		  bases, then there is only one such sparse representation;
		  it may be obtained by minimum $\ell^1$ norm atomic
		  decomposition. The condition ``sufficiently sparse''
		  becomes a multiscale condition; for example, that the
		  number of wavelets at level $j$ plus the number of
		  sinusoids in the $j$th dyadic frequency band are together
		  less than a constant times $2^{j/2}$. },

		  a superposition of atoms taken from a combined
		  time-frequency dictionary made of spike sequences
		  $1_{t=\tau}$ and sinusoids $\exp\{2\pi iw t/N\}/\sqrt{N}$.
		  Can one recover, from knowledge of $S$ alone, the precise
		  collection of atoms going to make up $S$? Because every
		  discrete-time signal can be represented as a superposition
		  of spikes alone, or as a superposition of sinusoids alone,
		  there is no unique way of writing S as a sum of spikes and
		  sinusoids in general. We prove that if $S$ is representable
		  as a highly sparse superposition of atoms from this
		  time-frequency dictionary, then there is only one such
		  highly sparse representation of $S$, and it can be obtained
		  by solving the convex optimization problem of minimizing
		  the $\ell^1$ norm of the coefficients among all
		  decompositions. Here ``highly sparse'' means that $N_t+N_w
		  < \sqrt{N}/2$ where $N_t$ is the number of time atoms,
		  $N_w$ is the number of frequency atoms, and $N$ is the
		  length of the discrete-time signal. Underlying this result
		  is a general $\ell^1$ uncertainty principle which says that
		  if two bases are mutually incoherent, no nonzero signal can
		  have a sparse representation in both bases simultaneously.
		  For the above setting, the bases are sinusoids and spikes,
		  and mutual incoherence is measured in terms of the largest
		  inner product between different basis elements. The
		  uncertainty principle holds for a variety of interesting
		  basis pairs, not just sinusoids and spikes. The results
		  have idealized applications to band-limited approximation
		  with gross errors, to error-correcting encryption, and to
		  separation of uncoordinated sources. Related phenomena hold
		  for functions of a real variable, with basis pairs such as
		  sinusoids and wavelets, and for functions of two variables,
		  with basis pairs such as wavelets and ridgelets. In these
		  settings, if a function f is representable by a
		  sufficiently sparse superposition of terms taken from both
		  bases, then there is only one such sparse representation;
		  it may be obtained by minimum $\ell^1$ norm atomic
		  decomposition. The condition ``sufficiently sparse''
		  becomes a multiscale condition; for example, that the
		  number of wavelets at level $j$ plus the number of
		  sinusoids in the $j$th dyadic frequency band are together
		  less than a constant times $2^{j/2}$. },

  abstract	= {Consider an underdetermined system of linear equations y =

		  this problem is NP-hard. However, for many matrices A there

		  We explain this by the theory of convex polytopes. Let aj

		  P is outwardly k-neighborly if every subset of k vertices

  abstract	= {Traditional sampling theories consider the problem of
		  reconstructing an unknown signal x from a series of
		  samples. A prevalent assumption which often guarantees
		  recovery from the given measurements is that x lies in a
		  known subspace. Recently, there has been growing interest
		  in nonlinear but structured signal models, in which x lies
		  in a union of subspaces. In this paper, we develop a
		  general framework for robust and efficient recovery of such
		  signals from a given set of samples. More specifically, we
		  treat the case in which x lies in a sum of k subspaces,
		  chosen from a larger set of m possibilities. The samples
		  are modeled as inner products with an arbitrary set of
		  sampling functions. To derive an efficient and robust
		  recovery algorithm, we show that our problem can be
		  formulated as that of recovering a block-sparse vector
		  whose nonzero elements appear in fixed blocks. We then
		  propose a mixed lscr2/lscr1 program for block sparse
		  recovery. Our main result is an equivalence condition under
		  which the proposed convex algorithm is guaranteed to
		  recover the original signal. This result relies on the
		  notion of block restricted isometry property (RIP), which
		  is a generalization of the standard RIP used extensively in
		  the context of compressed sensing. Based on RIP, we also
		  prove stability of our approach in the presence of noise
		  and modeling errors. A special case of our framework is
		  that of recovering multiple measurement vectors (MMV) that
		  share a joint sparsity pattern. Adapting our results to
		  this context leads to new MMV recovery methods as well as
		  equivalence conditions under which the entire set can be
		  determined efficiently. }

		  the compression of seismic data volumes by recently
		  developed curvelet frames. The elements of this transform
		  are multidimensional and directional and locally resemble
		  wavefronts present in the data, which leads to a
		  compressible representation for seismic data. This
		  compression enables us to formulate a new curvelet-based
		  seismic data recovery algorithm through sparsity-promoting
		  inversion. The concept of sparsity- promoting inversion is
		  in itself not new to geophysics. However, the recent
		  insights from the field of compressed sensing are new since
		  they clearly identify the three main ingredients that go
		  into a successful formulation of a recovery problem, namely
		  a sparsifying transform, a sampling strategy that subdues
		  coherent aliases and a sparsity-promoting program that
		  recovers the largest entries of the curvelet-domain vector
		  while explaining the measurements. These concepts are
		  illustrated with a stylized experiment that stresses the
		  importance of the degree of compression by the sparsifying
		  transform. With these findings, a curvelet- based recovery
		  algorithms is developed, which recovers seismic wavefields
		  from seismic data volumes with large percentages of traces
		  missing. During this construction, we benefit from the main
		  three ingredients of compressive sampling, namely the
		  curvelet compression of seismic data, the existence of a
		  favorable sampling scheme and the formulation of a large-
		  scale sparsity-promoting solver based on a cooling method.
		  The recovery performs well on synthetic as well as real
		  data and performs better by virtue of the sparsifying
		  property of curvelets. Our results are applicable to other
		  areas such as global seismology.}

  abstract	= {Seismic data recovery from data with missing traces on
		  otherwise regular acquisition grids forms a crucial step in
		  the seismic processing flow. For instance, unsuccessful
		  recovery leads to imaging artifacts and to erroneous
		  predictions for the multiples, adversely affecting the
		  performance of multiple elimination. A non-parametric
		  transform-based recovery method is presented that exploits
		  the compression of seismic data volumes by recently
		  developed curvelet frames. The elements of this transform
		  are multidimensional and directional and locally resemble
		  wavefronts present in the data, which leads to a
		  compressible representation for seismic data. This
		  compression enables us to formulate a new curvelet-based

  abstract	= {We present a source localization method based on a sparse
		  representation of sensor measurements with an overcomplete

		  enforce sparsity by imposing penalties based on the
		  $\ell_1$-norm. A number of recent theoretical results on
		  sparsifying properties of $\ell_1$ penalties justify this
		  choice. Explicitly enforcing the sparsity of the
		  representation is motivated by a desire to obtain a sharp
		  estimate of the spatial spectrum that exhibits
		  super-resolution. We propose to use the singular value
		  decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix to summarize
		  multiple time or frequency samples. Our formulation leads
		  to an optimization problem, which we solve efficiently in a
		  second-order cone (SOC) programming framework by an
		  interior point implementation. We propose a grid refinement
		  method to mitigate the effects of limiting estimates to a
		  grid of spatial locations and introduce an automatic
		  selection criterion for the regularization parameter
		  involved in our approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness
		  of the method on simulated data by plots of spatial spectra
		  and by comparing the estimator variance to the
		  Crame\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB). We observe that our approach
		  has a number of advantages over other source localization

		  {$\|L\cdot\|$} on {$\mathbb {R}^n$} under the constraint of
		  a bounded I-divergence $D(b,H\cdot)$ for rather general
		  linear operators $H$ and $L$. The I-divergence is also
		  known as Kullback–Leibler divergence and appears in many
		  models in imaging science, in particular when dealing with
		  Poisson data but also in the case of multiplicative Gamma
		  noise. Often H represents, e.g., a linear blur operator and
		  L is some discrete derivative or frame analysis operator. A
		  central part of this paper consists in proving relations
		  between the parameters of I-divergence constrained and
		  penalized problems. To solve the I-divergence constrained
		  problem, we consider various first-order primal–dual
		  algorithms which reduce the problem to the solution of
		  certain proximal minimization problems in each iteration
		  step. One of these proximation problems is an I-divergence
		  constrained least-squares problem which can be solved based
		  on Morozov’s discrepancy principle by a Newton method. We
		  prove that these algorithms produce not only a sequence of
		  vectors which converges to a minimizer of the constrained
		  problem but also a sequence of parameters which converges
		  to a regularization parameter so that the corresponding
		  penalized problem has the same solution. Furthermore, we
		  derive a rule for automatically setting the constraint
		  parameter for data corrupted by multiplicative Gamma noise.
		  The performance of the various algorithms is finally
		  demonstrated for different image restoration tasks both for
		  images corrupted by Poisson noise and multiplicative Gamma
		  noise.}
